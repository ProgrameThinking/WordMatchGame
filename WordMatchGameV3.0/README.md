# To the people looking through this version:

## Here is the functions that I have implemented：
***
On the basis of topic 2, expand the game from the local machine to a server multiplayer game platform, and use the client/server method to allow multiple people to log in to the system at the same time. Save all intruders and question maker information in the server. Requirements: 
* ◼Modifications must be made on the basis of topic 2. 
* ◼Use socket for communication. 
* ◼ Need to complete the server program and client program. The client can start multiple interactions with the server at the same time, requiring the server to have concurrent processing capabilities.

* ◼In addition to the single-player game, a two-player battle game is added. It is required that all players participating in the challenge have logged in. Two people face a word at the same time. The person who hits the correct word first will gain experience. The experience gained from single-player games of the same difficulty increases, and the loser needs to deduct a certain amount of experience. 
* ◼You can view the game passers who are online at the same time, you can challenge online game players, and enter the two-player battle after being challenged by the challenger.

Please refer to the code and design report for detailed design.
