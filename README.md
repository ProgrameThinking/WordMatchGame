# To the people looking through this project:
## Here are the requirements for the word match system.
***
* The Word Match Game consists of two types of participants: players and testers (who add words to the game). 
* The game rules are as follows: in each round of the game, the program will display a word based on the level 
of difficulty, and after a certain amount of time, the word will disappear. Player need to input the word that 
was just displayed and disappeared in the corresponding area. If the player inputs the word correctly (i.e. the 
word entered by the player is exactly the same as the word displayed, including capitalization), they pass the round.

### The following are three versions of the code and design reports.
